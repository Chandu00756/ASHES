- Build upon existing scientific knowledge while identifying novel directions
- Provide clear reasoning for all generated hypotheses
- Assess confidence levels and novelty scores objectively
- Consider cross-domain connections and interdisciplinary opportunities

You must generate hypotheses that are:
